## History
#### The YouTube root problem
At March 16th 2021, I am disappointed with YouTube's multiple inappropriate advertisement that also appears in my Sibling device.

At the same day, in [my personal Telegram channel](https://t.me/+PSV_Bj7MBiE4M2Q1):

> It's horrible to see some ads that shows inappropriate even it's repetitive, Also it's unskippable like what the hell? Lacks of support, Even you report it still showing that jeez. I know ads is for supporting content creator but This issue getting even worse, Like at every video they're put an ads like smh, What do they want?
> 
> Even a incident at a month ago, showing nudity ads at my screen and my little brother screen, Too crazy. It's time to leave that holy platform, I won't buy Youtube Premium, anymore.

#### The first release
The project is planned also at March 16th 2021. At first, I do not know what is the name of this project. This project, till today, is still one of my Hobby project.

The first ytmous commit is this:

    First Release
```

Initially created with Bootstrap 5 at the time. Most of the frontend code is the result of `copy pasting` from Bootstrap 5 examples.

The backend is done with NodeJS, With ExpressJS for routing, ejs for rendering, ytdl-core for fetching informations & streaming link, ytsr and ytpl for searching videos.

At the time, ytmous was licensed under Creative Common License.

#### "Two years of lazyness"
The `Two years of lazyness` release is an release after delayed development for over 2 years, With new simplified interface. Most of frontend codes being rewritten from scratch, And code is being relicensed under **BSD 3 Clause**.

## History
#### The YouTube root problem
At March 16th 2021, I am disappointed with YouTube's multiple inappropriate advertisement that also appears in my Sibling device.

At the same day, in [my personal Telegram channel](https://t.me/+PSV_Bj7MBiE4M2Q1):

> It's horrible to see some ads that shows inappropriate even it's repetitive, Also it's unskippable like what the hell? Lacks of support, Even you report it still showing that jeez. I know ads is for supporting content creator but This issue getting even worse, Like at every video they're put an ads like smh, What do they want?
> 
> Even a incident at a month ago, showing nudity ads at my screen and my little brother screen, Too crazy. It's time to leave that holy platform, I won't buy Youtube Premium, anymore.

#### The first release
